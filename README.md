## üöÄ How It Works

This app allows users to manage their tasks, projects, areas, notes, and tags in an organized way. Users can create tasks, projects, areas (to group projects), notes, and tags. Each task can be associated with a project, and both tasks and notes can be tagged for better organization. Projects can belong to areas and can also have multiple notes and tags. This structure helps users categorize and track their work efficiently, whether they‚Äôre managing individual tasks, larger projects, or keeping detailed notes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks. Mark tasks as completed and view them by different filters (Today, Upcoming, Someday). Order them by Name, Due Date, Date Created, or Priority.
- **Quick Notes**: Create, update, delete, or assign text notes to projects.
- **Tags**: Create tags for tasks and notes to enhance organization.
- **Project Tracking**: Organize tasks into projects. Each project can contain multiple tasks and/or multiple notes.
- **Area Categorization**: Group projects into areas for better organization and focus.
- **Due Date Tracking**: Set due dates for tasks and view them based on due date categories.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible from various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in multiple languages including English, German (de), Greek (el), Spanish (es), Japanese (jp), and Ukrainian (ua) among others.
- **Telegram Integration**:
  - Create tasks directly through Telegram messages
  - Receive daily digests of your tasks
  - Quick capture of ideas and todos on the go

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

**One simple command**, that's all it takes to run tududi with _docker_.

### üêã Docker

First pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull chrisvel/tududi:latest
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to configure tududi:

#### Required Variables:
- `TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL` - Initial admin user's email address (e.g., `admin@example.com`)
- `TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD` - Initial admin user's password (use a strong password!)
- `TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key (generate with `openssl rand -hex 64`)

#### Optional Variables:
- `TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED` - Set to 'true' if using HTTPS internally (default: false)
- `TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Controls CORS access for different deployment scenarios:
  - Not set: Only allows localhost origins
  - Specific domains: `https://tududi.com,http://localhost:9292`
  - Allow all (development only): Set to empty string `""`

#### Common Configuration Examples:

##### Local Development
```bash
export TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=dev@local.test
export TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=devpassword123
export TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
export TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=false
# TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS not set - defaults to localhost only
```

##### Production with Reverse Proxy
```bash
export TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
export TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
export TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
export TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=true
export TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tududi.yourdomain.com
```

### üöÄ Running with Docker

```bash
docker run \
  -e TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=myemail@example.com \
  -e TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword \
  -e TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64) \
  -e TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=false \
  -e TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tududi,http://tududi:9292 \
  -v ~/tududi_db:/usr/src/app/tududi_db \
