## üöÄ How It Works

This app allows users to manage their tasks, projects, areas, notes, and tags in an organized way. Users can create tasks, projects, areas (to group projects), notes, and tags. Each task can be associated with a project, and both tasks and notes can be tagged for better organization. Projects can belong to areas and can also have multiple notes and tags. This structure helps users categorize and track their work efficiently, whether they‚Äôre managing individual tasks, larger projects, or keeping detailed notes.

## üß† Philosophy

For the thinking behind tududi, read [Designing a Life Management System That Doesn't Fight Back]([https://example.com/designing-a-life-management-system-that-doesnt-fight-back](https://medium.com/@chrisveleris/designing-a-life-management-system-that-doesnt-fight-back-2fd58773e857))

## üîÑ Recurring Tasks

tududi features a sophisticated recurring task system designed to handle complex scheduling needs while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

### Recurrence Patterns

- **Daily**: Repeat every N days
- **Weekly**: Repeat every N weeks, optionally on specific weekdays
- **Monthly**: Repeat every N months on a specific date
- **Monthly Weekday**: Repeat on the Nth occurrence of a weekday (e.g., "2nd Tuesday of every month")
- **Monthly Last Day**: Repeat on the last day of every month

### Smart Parent-Child Relationships

When a recurring task generates new instances:
- Each generated task maintains a link to its parent recurring task
- Generated tasks display as "Recurring Task Instance" with inherited settings
- Users can edit the parent's recurrence pattern directly from any child task
- Changes to parent settings affect all future instances in the series

### Completion-Based Recurrence

Choose between two recurrence behaviors:
- **Due Date Based** (default): Next task scheduled based on original due date
- **Completion Based**: Next task scheduled based on when the task is actually completed

This is particularly useful for tasks like "Weekly grocery shopping" where you want the next instance to appear a week after you complete it, regardless of when it was originally due.

### Example Use Cases

- **Daily Habits**: "Take vitamins" (daily)
- **Weekly Routines**: "Grocery shopping" (every Sunday, completion-based)
- **Monthly Bills**: "Pay rent" (1st of every month)
- **Quarterly Reviews**: "Team performance review" (1st Monday of every 3 months)
- **Maintenance Tasks**: "Change air filter" (every 3 months, completion-based)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker

**One simple command**, that's all it takes to run tududi with Docker.

First pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull chrisvel/tududi:latest
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to configure tududi:

#### Required Variables:
- `TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL` - Initial admin user's email address (e.g., `admin@example.com`)
- `TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD` - Initial admin user's password (use a strong password!)
- `TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key (generate with `openssl rand -hex 64`)

#### Optional Variables:
- `PUID`, `GUID` - Run with specified user and group ID (instead of defaults 1001/1001)
- `TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED` - Set to 'true' if using HTTPS internally (default: false)
- `TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Controls CORS access for different deployment scenarios:
  - Not set: Only allows localhost origins
  - Specific domains: `https://tududi.com,http://localhost:3002`
  - Allow all (development only): Set to empty string `""`

#### Common Configuration Examples:

##### Local Development
```bash
export TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=dev@local.test
export TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=devpassword123
export TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
export TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=false
# TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS not set - defaults to localhost only
```

##### Production with Reverse Proxy
```bash
export TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
export TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
export TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
export TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=true
export TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tududi.yourdomain.com
```

### üöÄ Running with Docker

```bash
docker run \
  -e TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=myemail@example.com \
  -e TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword \
  -e TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64) \
  -e TUDUDI_INTERNAL_SSL_ENABLED=false \
  -e TUDUDI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tududi,http://tududi:3002 \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e GUID=1001 \
  -v ~/tududi_db:/app/backend/db \
  -v ~/tududi_uploads:/app/backend/uploads \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  -d chrisvel/tududi:latest
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) and login with your credentials.

## üì± Telegram Integration Setup

tududi includes built-in Telegram integration that allows you to create tasks directly from Telegram messages. This feature is optional and can be configured after installation.

### ü§ñ Creating a Telegram Bot

1. **Start a chat with @BotFather** on Telegram
2. **Create a new bot**:
   ```
   /newbot
   ```
3. **Choose a name** for your bot (e.g., "My tududi Bot")
4. **Choose a username** for your bot (must end with "bot", e.g., "mytududi_bot")
5. **Save the bot token** - BotFather will provide a token like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxyz`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Telegram Integration

#### Method: Through the Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Login to tududi** and go to Settings
2. **Navigate to the Telegram tab**
3. **Paste your bot token** from BotFather
4. **Click "Setup Telegram"** - this will:
   - Validate your bot token
   - Display your bot's username
   - Provide a direct link to start chatting with your bot
5. **Start chatting** with your bot by clicking the provided link or searching for your bot in Telegram
6. **Send your first message** to your bot - it will automatically appear in your tududi inbox!

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Message Collection**: tududi polls your bot every 30 seconds for new messages
2. **Automatic Inbox Creation**: Every message sent to your bot creates a new item in your tududi inbox
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: The same message won't create multiple inbox items
4. **Processing**: You can then process inbox items into tasks, projects, or notes

### üìä Telegram Settings Overview

In the Telegram settings tab, you can:

- **Bot Setup**: Configure your bot token and view connection status
- **Polling Control**: Start/stop message polling manually
- **Bot Information**: View bot username and connection status
- **Test Integration**: Send a test message to verify connectivity
- **Task Summaries**: Enable/disable daily task summary notifications

### üîß Troubleshooting

**Bot not receiving messages:**
- Verify your bot token is correct
- Ensure you've started a conversation with your bot in Telegram
- Check that polling is active in the Telegram settings
- Verify your server can reach Telegram's API (check firewall settings)

**Messages not appearing in inbox:**
- Check the polling status in Telegram settings
- Verify your bot token hasn't expired
- Ensure your account is properly connected to the bot

**Bot setup failing:**
- Double-check your bot token format (should be like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxyz`)
- Verify your bot is active and not deleted
- Check your internet connection

### üîí Security Considerations

- **Bot tokens are stored securely** in your local database
- **Only you can send messages** to your bot (private by default)
- **No data is shared** with third parties - everything runs on your self-hosted instance
- **Tokens are encrypted** in transit and at rest

### üö´ Disabling Telegram Integration

To completely disable Telegram integration:

1. **Via Interface**: Simply don't configure a bot token in the settings
2. **Remove Bot Token**: Delete your bot token from the Telegram settings to stop all integration

### üîë Authentication

The application uses session-based authentication with secure cookies. For development:
- Frontend runs on port 8080 with webpack dev server
- Backend runs on port 3001 and handles authentication
- CORS is configured to allow cross-origin requests during development
- In production (Docker), both frontend and backend run on the same port (3002)

## üöß Development

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- Express.js
- SQLite3
- npm
- ReactJS

### üèó Installation

To install `tududi`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrisvel/tududi.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tududi
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies (frontend and backend)
   npm install
   ```

### üîí SSL Setup (Optional)

For HTTPS support, create SSL certificates:

1. Create and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir backend/certs
   cd backend/certs
   ```
2. Create the key and cert:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
   openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
   cd ../..
   ```

### üìÇ Database Setup

The database will be automatically initialized when you start the Express backend. For manual database operations:

```bash
# Initialize database (creates tables, drops existing data)
npm run db:init

# Sync database (creates tables if they don't exist)
npm run db:sync

# Migrate database (alters existing tables to match models)
npm run db:migrate

# Reset database (drops and recreates all tables)
npm run db:reset

# Check database status and connection
npm run db:status
```

### üîÑ Database Migrations

For schema changes, use Sequelize migrations (similar to Rails/Ruby migrations):

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run migration:create add-description-to-tasks

# Run pending migrations
npm run migration:run

# Check migration status
npm run migration:status

# Rollback last migration
npm run migration:undo

# Rollback all migrations
npm run migration:undo:all
```

#### Creating a New Migration Example:
```bash
# 1. Create the migration file
npm run migration:create add-priority-to-projects

# 2. Edit the generated file in migrations/ folder:
# - Add your schema changes in the 'up' function
# - Add rollback logic in the 'down' function

# 3. Run the migration
npm run migration:run
```

### üë§ User Setup

#### For Development

Set environment variables to automatically create the initial user:

```bash
export TUDUDI_USER_EMAIL=dev@example.com
export TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD=password123
export TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
```

Or create a user manually:
```bash
npm run user:create dev@example.com password123
```

#### Default Development Credentials

If no environment variables are set, you can use the default development credentials:
- Email: `dev@example.com`  
- Password: `password123`

### üöÄ Usage

To start the application for development:

1. **Start the Express backend** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run backend:dev    # Development mode with auto-reload
   # Or: npm run backend:start  # Production mode
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Start the frontend development server** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run frontend:dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Access the application**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

### Port Configuration

- **Development Frontend**: `http://localhost:8080` (webpack dev server)
- **Development Backend**: `http://localhost:3001` (Express API server)
- **Docker/Production**: `http://localhost:3002` (combined frontend + backend)

The webpack dev server automatically proxies API calls and locales to the backend server.

### üîç Testing 

To run tests:

```bash
# Backend tests
npm run backend:test

# Frontend tests  
npm run frontend:test
```

#### Test Coverage

The application includes comprehensive test coverage for:
- **Backend API endpoints** (tasks, projects, areas, notes, tags, auth)
- **Database models and migrations**
- **Recurring task service and date calculations**
- **Frontend components and utilities**
- **Authentication and session management**

**Note**: Comprehensive test coverage for the new recurring tasks functionality is planned and will include:
- Recurring task generation algorithms
- Parent-child relationship management
- Date calculation edge cases
- Frontend recurring task components
- Integration tests for complete recurring task workflows

The application has been fully migrated from Ruby/Sinatra to a functional programming Express.js implementation.
