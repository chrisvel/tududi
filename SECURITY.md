## Security Best Practices

When deploying tududi, we recommend:

### Production Deployment

- **Use strong passwords:** Set secure `TUDUDI_USER_PASSWORD` and `TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET`
- **HTTPS only:** Always use HTTPS in production (reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt)
- **Keep updated:** Regularly update to the latest version
- **Secure database:** Protect database files with proper permissions
- **Environment variables:** Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control
- **Backup regularly:** Keep secure backups of your database

### Docker Security

```bash
# Generate strong session secret
TUDUDI_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)

# Use secure volumes with proper permissions
chmod 700 ~/tududi_db
chmod 700 ~/tududi_uploads
```

### Self-Hosting Checklist

- [ ] Strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificate
- [ ] Database files protected (not publicly accessible)
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Firewall configured to restrict access
- [ ] Regular backups scheduled

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication & Sessions

- Sessions use `express-session` with secure settings
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Session secrets should be cryptographically random (64+ characters)

### Data Storage

- SQLite database stores all user data
- Uploads are stored in the filesystem
- Ensure proper file permissions on production servers

### Telegram Integration

- Bot tokens are sensitive credentials
- Store `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` securely
- Never expose tokens in logs or error messages

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.85.1 â†’ 0.85.2). Critical vulnerabilities may warrant immediate releases.
